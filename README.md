# Java Hangman Game

This was my first attempt at a Java App. Took a long while to get my head around testing and the syntax and finally got on to mocking with Mockito which I enjoyed. This was what I was able to complete with a few hours of work, didn't get as far as I'd have liked but built a better understanding of Java, JUnit and mocking along the way. Will try and add to this a little more to finish the basic game at the very least.
